1. Software project management is the process of planning, organizing, and overseeing software development projects to ensure they are completed on time and within budget. It is crucial because it helps maximize productivity, manage risks, and ensure successful project delivery.

2. Planning - Requirements gathering, defining scope, setting milestones.
Analysis - Reviewing requirements, feasibility study, creating specifications.
Design - Creating architecture, UI/UX design, detailed design planning.
Implementation - Writing code, unit testing, integration testing.
Testing - System testing, performance testing, user acceptance testing.
Deployment - Installing software, training users, finalizing documentation.
Maintenance - Bug fixes, updates, enhancements based on user feedback.

3. 1. Agile:
              Advantages
  - Flexibility to adapt to changing requirements.
  - Iterative development allows for frequent feedback.
            Disadvantages
  - Can lead to scope creep without proper oversight.
  - Requires active involvement from the customer throughout the project.

2. Waterfall:
              Advantages
  - Clear project milestones and deliverables.
  - Simple to understand and implement.
            Disadvantages
  - Limited flexibility for changes once a phase is completed.
  - Less customer involvement can lead to misalignment with requirements.

4. The key components of project planning in software project management include defining project scope, setting objectives, creating a timeline, allocating resources, identifying risks, and establishing a communication plan. Common tools and techniques used to create a project plan include Gantt charts, work breakdown structures (WBS), agile methodologies, project management software, and risk management strategies.
